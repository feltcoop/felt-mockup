# Felt setup for vscode

We recommend [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
for its Svelte support.
Other editors may have varying degrees of support -
see [sveltejs/integrations](https://github.com/sveltejs/integrations) for more.

Felt is not currently being tested on Windows.
[WSL2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/wsl2-install)
provides a near-seamless experience running a Linux distro on Windows
via the VSCode extension
[Remote - WSL](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-wsl).

[VSCodium](https://vscodium.com/) is a nice free/libre fork of VSCode.
Unfortunately it does not work with WSL on Windows when this was written.
